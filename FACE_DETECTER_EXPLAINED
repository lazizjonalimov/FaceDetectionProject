How computer knows the face and how it understands that it actually a person's face and not other thing

# Face Detection:

What is "Haar Cascade"? - haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

    = It is an algorithm, like a machine learning thing that makes images pass trough and
    It looks at every every size of the image and it passes each of those squares through this machine learning
    thing, then it cascades down eventually >>> close enough to a face to be considered a face
    haar = name of the person who created this algorithm
    cascade = like a chain of events


Haar Features (aka rudimentary building blocks) = all little blocks = shows the relationship of the white portion
from the black portion, which allows us to approximate the relationship of the faces within this box.

    a) edge features
    b) line features
    c) four-rectangle features

If we chain these featues over and over again enough, then their combination will give a template for a face. So, it
will look like a face. So, they find faces by laying the above box features over and over again and cascading over and
over again all the way down these different layers, and then finding the one that actually matches the face.

 = we give faces, it finds out combination of box features above
